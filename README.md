## Introduction

This project serves as a foundation for building dynamic web applications using the MERN stack. Each component (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) plays a crucial role in creating a seamless development and deployment experience.

## Features

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building robust APIs.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
